    <h3>What is a online wallet, and why is there a login?:</h3> We provide a service where we store your encrypted keystores in our secure online database for your convenience. Your keystores are all encrypted and decrypted
    clientside (on your computer), and are transmitted to our database already encrypted. Therefore, it is impossible for us to access your private keys or change your password. It is extremely important
    that you back up all keystore files and do not rely on any third party, including us, to keep it forever. Use our online wallet option for convenience only.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
    <h3>We are not like an exchange account:</h3> Because we don't have access to your private keys, we cannot help you if you lose your password, or lose your private key. Back up your passwords and keystores
    in multiple locations.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
    <h3>What if I don't want to create an online account?:</h3> Simply click the "Local wallet mode" at the sign in page, and you can manually load your wallets from a local source without sending
    any data to our servers.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>Always backup your keys:</h3> Helios wallet is not a bank.. You do not create an account or give us your funds to hold onto. It is impossible for us to access your funds. When interacting with the blockchain, no data leaves your computer / your browser. We make it easy for you to create, save, and access your information and interact with the helios blockchain.
    </p>

    <h3>We are not responsible for any loss:</h3> Helios wallet, and some of the underlying Javascript libraries we use are under active development. While we have thoroughly tested & tens of thousands of wallets have been successfully created by people all over the globe, there is always the possibility something unexpected happens that causes your funds to be lost. Please do not invest more than you are willing to lose, and please be careful.
