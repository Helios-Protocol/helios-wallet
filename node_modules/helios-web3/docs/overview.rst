Helios Web3 js documentation overview
=====================================

Helios Web3 js is built to be a direct replacement over the ethereum web3. It includes most of the
same functionality that you have in ethereum's web3. You can find documentation for that here: `https://web3js.readthedocs.io <https://web3js.readthedocs.io>`_.


**Web3.utils** has many useful utilities. The documentation for this is found here: `https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-utils.html <https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-utils.html>`_.
**Web3.hls.account** has the same functionality as Ethereum's. The documentatiuon for this is found here: `https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-accounts.html <https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-accounts.html>`_.

However, we have also added some new functionality that is specific to helios. This additional functionality is documented in
the other files in this folder.
